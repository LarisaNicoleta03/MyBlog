    <p class="descript">The Hawaiian Islands itinerary that can change your life isn’t found in any guidebooks. Because what makes the Hawaiian Islands truly special is not only our stunning natural beauty or our vibrant culture - it’s the deeply rooted relationship that connects them. 
 
        That relationship between people and place grows stronger every time you mālama (give back). When you give back - to the land, the ocean, the wildlife, the forest, the fishpond, the community - you’re part of a virtuous circle that enriches everything and everyone. Including your experience as a visitor. Several organizations offer opportunities for visitors to pay it forward, like beach clean-ups, native tree planting, and more. Engage in some of our volunteer opportunities below, and in exchange, experience Hawaiʻi on a much deeper and connected level. Through the Mālama Hawaiʻi Program, you could qualify for a special discount or even a free night from a participating hotel when participating in its dedicated volunteer activity.</p>

    <p class="descript">Sure, we all scream for ice cream, but we really holler our heads off for the best ice cream—especially the best store bought ice cream. The Sporked team has tasted a lot of ice cream, and here we’ve compiled all the best ice cream we’ve tried so far. Get your spoons and your vocal cords ready and read on for the best store bought vanilla ice cream, the best keto ice cream, and more.</p>

    <p class="descript">Avatar (marketed as James Cameron's Avatar) is a 2009 epic science fiction film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez,[6] and Sigourney Weaver. It is the first installment in the Avatar film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]</p>
